# NexTrain
Notification system for UMN GreenLine departure times

#Use
Download the zip file, and unpack it.  Then open in terminal and run "python information.py".  Follow the prompts, and make sure all input is case sensitive.

#Preferences
E-mail is a more reliably source of delivery, due to cellphones having spotty reception.  The email always gets sent, but the phone will only recieve it 75% of the time.<br><br>
Do not enter a UMN x500 for the e-mail, the UMN Gmail does not allow the preferences needed.
Make sure to allow "Access from less secure apps" on your Gmail.
#ToDo
Add multi-user support for use on a server
#Comments
This program is still in the testing phase<br>
